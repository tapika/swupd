Chocolatey would have used NuGet to install packages (if they are not already installed):
installpackage
[NuGet] Installing 'installpackage 1.0.0'.
[NuGet] Successfully installed 'installpackage 1.0.0'.

installpackage v1.0.0
Would have run 'chocolateyinstall.ps1':
$toolsDir = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"
"simple file" | Out-File "$toolsDir\simplefile.txt" -force

Write-Output "This is $packageName v$packageVersion being installed"
Write-Host "Ya!"
Write-Debug "A debug message"
Write-Verbose "Yo!"
Write-Warning "A warning!"

Write-Output "$packageName v$packageVersion has been installed"
=> folder was not updated
end of test
