    /// <remarks>
    /// This interface can be implemented on messages (see <see cref="IODataRequestMessage"/> and
    /// <see cref="IODataResponseMessage"/>). When a message implementing this interface is
    /// passed to an <see cref="ODataMessageWriter"/> or <see cref="ODataMessageReader"/>, the
    /// message writer/reader will use this interface for custom URL resolution.
    /// On writers this means that whenever a URI is written into the payload the resolution
    /// method on this interface is called to resolve a base URI and a payload URI to the
    /// actual URI to be written to the payload. If the method returns null from a resolution
    /// call the default resolution will be used.
    /// On readers this means that a base URI (either from the payload or the reader settings) and
    /// the URI read from the payload are passed to the method. The result is what is being reported
    /// on the OData OM instances. Again if the resolution method returns null the default resolution
    /// kicks in.
