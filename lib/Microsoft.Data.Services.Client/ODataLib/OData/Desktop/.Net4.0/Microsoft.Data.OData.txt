RequestUriProcessor_TargetEntitySetNotFound=The target Entity Set of Navigation Property '{0}' could not be found. This is most likely an error in the IEdmModel.
RequestUriProcessor_FoundInvalidFunctionImport=The function overloads matching '{0}' are invalid. This is most likely an error in the IEdmModel.

OperationSegment_ReturnTypeForMultipleOverloads=No type could be computed for this Segment since there were multiple possible operations with varying return types.
OperationSegment_CannotReturnNull=The return type from the operation is not possible with the given entity set.

SingleValueFunctionCallNode_FunctionImportsWithLegacyConstructor=Please construct this SingleValueFunctionCallNode using the IEnumerable<IEdmFunctionImport> overload before accessing FunctionImports.

SingleEntityFunctionCallNode_CallFunctionImportsUsingLegacyConstructor=Please construct this SingleEntityFunctionCallNode using the IEnumerable<IEdmFunctionImport> overload before accessing FunctionImports.

SegmentArgumentParser_TryConvertValuesForNamedValues=Calling the wrong overload to convert named values to type.
SegmentArgumentParser_TryConvertValuesToNonPrimitive=Cannot use a non-primitive type as a parameter.
SegmentArgumentParser_TryConvertValuesForPositionalValues=Calling the wrong overload to convert positional values to type.

FunctionOverloadResolver_NoSingleMatchFound=Unable to resolve function overloads to a single function. There was more than one function in the model with name '{0}' and parameter names '{1}'.

; Copied from the server, will be incrementally replaced.
RequestUriProcessor_EmptySegmentInRequestUrl=Empty segment encountered in request URL. Please make sure that a valid request URL is specified.
RequestUriProcessor_SyntaxError=Bad Request - Error in query syntax.
RequestUriProcessor_CannotSpecifyAfterPostLinkSegment=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' is not valid. Since the uri contains the '{1}' segment, there must be only one segment specified after that.
RequestUriProcessor_CountOnRoot=The request URI is not valid, the segment $count cannot be applied to the root of the service.
RequestUriProcessor_MustBeLeafSegment=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' must be the last segment in the URI because it is one of the following: $batch, $value, $metadata, a collection property, a named media resource, a service operation that does not return a value, or a service action.
RequestUriProcessor_LinkSegmentMustBeFollowedByEntitySegment=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' must refer to a navigation property since the previous segment identifier is '{1}'.
RequestUriProcessor_MissingSegmentAfterLink=The request URI is not valid. There must a segment specified after the '{0}' segment and the segment must refer to a entity resource.
RequestUriProcessor_CountNotSupported=The request URI is not valid, $count cannot be applied to the segment '{0}' since $count can only follow a resource segment.
RequestUriProcessor_CannotQuerySingletons=The request URI is not valid, since the segment '{0}' refers to a singleton, and the segment '{1}' can only follow a resource collection.
RequestUriProcessor_CannotQueryCollections=The request URI is not valid. Since the segment '{0}' refers to a collection, this must be the last segment in the request URI. All intermediate segments must refer to a single resource.
RequestUriProcessor_SegmentDoesNotSupportKeyPredicates=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' cannot include key predicates, however it may end with empty parenthesis.
RequestUriProcessor_ValueSegmentAfterScalarPropertySegment=The segment '{1}' in the request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' refers to a primitive property, function, or service operation, so the only supported value from the next segment is '$value'.
RequestUriProcessor_InvalidTypeIdentifier_UnrelatedType=The type '{0}' specified in the URI is neither a base type nor a sub-type of the previously-specified type '{1}'.
ResourceType_ComplexTypeCannotBeOpen=Complex types can not be marked as 'Open'. Error occurred for type '{0}'.
BadRequest_ValuesCannotBeReturnedForSpatialTypes=$value must not be specified for spatial values.
OpenNavigationPropertiesNotSupportedOnOpenTypes=Open navigation properties are not supported on OpenTypes. Property name: '{0}'.
BadRequest_ResourceCanBeCrossReferencedOnlyForBindOperation=Error processing request stream. In batch mode, a resource can be cross-referenced only for bind/unbind operations. 
DataServiceConfiguration_ResponseVersionIsBiggerThanProtocolVersion=The response requires that version {0} of the protocol be used, but the MaxProtocolVersion of the data service is set to {1}.
BadRequest_KeyCountMismatch=The number of keys specified in the URI does not match number of key properties for the resource '{0}'.
RequestUriProcessor_KeysMustBeNamed=Segments with multiple key values must specify them in 'name=value' form.
RequestUriProcessor_ResourceNotFound=Resource not found for the segment '{0}'.
RequestUriProcessor_BatchedActionOnEntityCreatedInSameChangeset=Batched service action '{0}' cannot be invoked because it was bound to an entity created in the same changeset.
RequestUriProcessor_IEnumerableServiceOperationsCannotBeFurtherComposed=Resource Not Found - '{0}' refers to a service operation or function which does not allow further composition.
RequestUriProcessor_Forbidden=Forbidden
RequestUriProcessor_OperationSegmentBoundToANonEntityType=Found an operation bound to a non-entity type.
